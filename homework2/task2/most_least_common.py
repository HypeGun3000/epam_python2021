    Given an array of size n, find the most common
    and the least common elements.
    The most common element is the element that appears more than n // 2 times.
    The least common element is the element that appears fewer than other.
    You may assume that the array is non-empty and the most common element
    always exist in the array.

    Example 1:
    Input: [3,2,3]
    Output: 3, 2
    Example 2:
    Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
    Output: 2, 1
